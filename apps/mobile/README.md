# T3 Code Mobile

> [!WARNING]
> T3 Code Mobile is currently in development and is not distributed yet. If you want to try it out, you can build it from source.

## Quickstart

> [!NOTE]
> Uses native modules so using Expo Go is not supported. You need to use the Expo Dev Client.

This app has three variants:

- `development`: Expo dev client, installable side-by-side as `T3 Code Dev`
- `preview`: persistent internal preview build, installable side-by-side as `T3 Code Preview`
- `production`: store/release build as `T3 Code`

Run commands from `apps/mobile`.

T3 Connect is optional and disabled in a fresh clone. Public configuration belongs in the
repository-root `.env` or `.env.local`, not an `apps/mobile/.env` file. See
[`../../.env.example`](../../.env.example).

## Development

Start Metro for the dev client:

```bash
vp run dev:client
```

Build and run the local iOS dev client:

```bash
vp run ios:dev
```

Build and run the local iOS preview app:

```bash
vp run ios:preview
```

Force the review diff highlighter engine:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_REVIEW_HIGHLIGHTER_ENGINE=javascript vp run ios:dev
```

`javascript` is the default and recommended setting for the review diff screen. Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_REVIEW_HIGHLIGHTER_ENGINE=native` only when you explicitly want to test the native Shiki engine.

Inspect the resolved Expo config for a variant:

```bash
vp run config:dev
vp run config:preview
```

Run static checks for mobile native code:

```bash
node ../../scripts/mobile-native-static-check.ts
```

The native lint task runs SwiftLint for Swift plus ktlint and detekt for Kotlin. Missing native tools are reported as warnings and skipped locally. CI installs the default toolset from `apps/mobile/Brewfile` before running the native checks.

## EAS Builds

CI uses Expo fingerprinting with the `preview:dev` profile to reuse an existing compatible build when possible, or start a new internal EAS build when native runtime inputs change. Production and default local builds continue to use the `appVersion` runtime policy.

This fork's local EAS overlay targets `@h14h/h4code`:

- Expo project: <https://expo.dev/accounts/h14h/projects/h4code>
- EAS project ID: `64e1574c-280b-49a0-989e-471d942c0b4f`
- iOS/Android app ID base: `com.h14h.h4code`

The overlay is intentionally concentrated in `app.config.ts`, so it can be kept as a small patch and reapplied after upstream updates. Override the defaults with repository-root `.env.local` values only if you need a different Expo account, EAS project, app ID base, or Apple team:

```bash
T3CODE_MOBILE_EXPO_OWNER=h14h
T3CODE_MOBILE_EXPO_SLUG=h4code
T3CODE_MOBILE_EAS_PROJECT_ID=64e1574c-280b-49a0-989e-471d942c0b4f
T3CODE_MOBILE_APP_ID_BASE=com.h14h.h4code
T3CODE_MOBILE_APPLE_TEAM_ID=YOURTEAMID
```

For preview or production EAS environments, set `T3CODE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`,
`T3CODE_CLERK_JWT_TEMPLATE`, and `T3CODE_RELAY_URL`
as EAS environment variables. Expo config maps the canonical values into the mobile build.

Create a PR preview dev-client build manually:

```bash
vp run eas:ios:preview:dev
```

Create a cloud dev-client build:

```bash
vp run eas:ios:dev
```

Create a persistent preview build:

```bash
vp run eas:ios:preview
```

Android equivalents:

```bash
vp run eas:android:dev
vp run eas:android:preview:dev
vp run eas:android:preview
```
